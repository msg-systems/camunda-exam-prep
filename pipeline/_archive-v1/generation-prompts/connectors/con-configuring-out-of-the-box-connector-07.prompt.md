### Strict lint rules (any violation → reject)

| Code                          | Rule |
| ----------------------------- | ---- |
| scenario-too-short            | scenario < 150 chars |
| scenario-missing-domain-marker | scenario lacks a named company or domain noun (bank/insurer/saas/healthcare/fintech/logistics/retailer/airline/marketplace/...) |
| scenario-missing-measurable   | scenario lacks a number with unit: €/$ amount, %, duration (PT2H / "2 hours"), or count ("3000 claims") |
| question-too-short            | question < 25 chars |
| question-not-interrogative    | question doesn't end with '?' |
| option-count-not-4            | options array length ≠ 4 |
| option-id-not-abcd            | option ids ≠ a/b/c/d (exact, in order) |
| option-too-short              | any option text < 40 chars |
| option-length-ratio           | max(option lengths) / min(option lengths) > 1.4 — keep the four options length-parallel |
| meta-vocab-in-option          | option text contains: incorrect, wrong, partial, anti-pattern, misnomer, overstates, understates, misleading, not supported, deprecated |
| em-dash-in-option             | U+2014 em-dash in an option — use '--' instead |
| option-self-rationale         | option starts with 'because' or 'since' — options must be statements, not justifications |
| markdown-in-option            | option text contains markdown (** _ ` [text](url)) |
| internal-ref-leak             | option text contains an internal ref like 'foo.md:23' or '(:32-43)' |
| correct-id-not-in-options     | correctOptionId not one of the option ids |
| option-explanations-missing   | optionExplanations missing any of a/b/c/d |
| explanation-verdict-mismatch  | per-option explanation doesn't start with 'Correct.' (when id == correctOptionId) or 'Incorrect.' (otherwise) |
| docs-url-missing-or-wrong-host | no docs[] entry, or url not on https://docs.camunda.io/docs/ |
| version-marker-missing        | camundaVersion ≠ '8.8' |
| topic-not-in-blueprint        | topic not one of the 8 listed in the schema |

Additionally:
- Options must be parallel statements — same grammatical form, similar length, no embedded sub-clauses that grade themselves ("which correctly handles..."). The OPTIONS state WHAT, the EXPLANATIONS state WHY.
- Never include phrases like "This approach...", "This pattern...", "Camunda 8 supports/allows/requires...", "teams should...", "is the canonical/recommended approach", "However,...", "In reality,..." inside option text. Save all that for the explanation fields.
- Distractors must be plausible Camunda traps (Camunda-7 confusion, version drift, similar-but-different element, wrong scope, wrong direction of mapping, wrong cardinality). They must NOT be obviously absurd.
- Every fact (the correct answer AND why each distractor is wrong) must be supported by the SOURCE chunk below. No facts pulled from outside the chunk except universally-known C8.8 schema constants.

### Authoring rubric (distilled)

- **Style "scenario"** (most items): scenario sets a concrete C8.8 situation with a named company + measurable; question asks a single targeted question; options are 4 parallel WHAT-statements; explanations carry the WHY.
- **Style "concept"**: scenario can be lighter on narrative but must still cite a measurable from the docs (e.g. "default retry count of 3"). Question targets a definition or rule.
- **Style "recall"**: scenario describes a real configuration choice; question asks which value/expression/property is required. Still needs domain marker + measurable.

### Exemplars (same topic — match this voice and structure, NOT the subject)

**Exemplar 1** (from authored pool):

    "c": { "text": "Incorrect. The format is a map, not a list of equal-delimited strings; the connector does not parse that shape into header pairs." },

### Source chunk — ALL facts in your answer must trace back to this content

**File**: `pipeline/sources/connectors/configuring-out-of-the-box-connector.md`
**Public URL**: https://docs.camunda.io/docs/components/connectors/use-connectors/configuring-out-of-the-box-connector/
**Section heading**: Add a connector

```markdown
## Add a connector

Here, a receipt is initially uploaded for review. The first task we need to complete is notifying the manager of the uploaded receipt. If we want to leverage our email service to notify the manager, we can utilize a productivity applications connector to replace this task.

:::note
Camunda offers a variety of available connectors. For example, utilize cloud connectors to communicate with cloud-native applications and conform to REST, GraphQL, or SOAP protocols. Or, employ service connectors to integrate with technology enablers like RPA, AI or IOT services. Learn more about our [available connectors](/components/connectors/out-of-the-box-connectors/available-connectors-overview.md) to find out which may best suit your business needs.
:::

To add our productivity applications connector, take the following steps:

1. Click the start event. A context pad to the right of the start event will appear.
2. Click the **Append connector** item in the panel.
3. To send an email via SendGrid, for example, select the **SendGrid Email connector** option. Name this newly-created task `Notify manger of receipt`. This now replaces our original task.
   ![adding a connector](./img/adding-connector.png)
4. You need to fill out the required information in the properties panel of this task on the right side of the screen. Here, we'll add an example API key obtained from our [SendGrid account](https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/api_keys), a sender and receiver name and email address, and the email message content.

![filling out connector properties panel](./img/connector-properties-panel.png)

Our connector is now attached and ready to use. Your completed diagram should look like the following:

### Final reminders

1. Write the JSON to **pipeline/generation/outputs/connectors/con-configuring-out-of-the-box-connector-07.json** and nothing else.
2. The id MUST be `con-configuring-out-of-the-box-connector-07`.
3. The docs[0].url MUST be `https://docs.camunda.io/docs/components/connectors/use-connectors/configuring-out-of-the-box-connector/`.
4. camundaVersion MUST be the string `"8.8"`.
5. Every option starts with a capital letter and has NO leading "Because/Since", no markdown, no em-dash.
6. The correct option's `optionExplanations[correctOptionId].text` begins with `Correct.`; each of the other three begins with `Incorrect.`.
7. The `explanation` field is a teaching note — it must NOT begin with "Correct."/"Incorrect.".
