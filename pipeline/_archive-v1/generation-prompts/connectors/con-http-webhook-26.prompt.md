### Strict lint rules (any violation → reject)

| Code                          | Rule |
| ----------------------------- | ---- |
| scenario-too-short            | scenario < 150 chars |
| scenario-missing-domain-marker | scenario lacks a named company or domain noun (bank/insurer/saas/healthcare/fintech/logistics/retailer/airline/marketplace/...) |
| scenario-missing-measurable   | scenario lacks a number with unit: €/$ amount, %, duration (PT2H / "2 hours"), or count ("3000 claims") |
| question-too-short            | question < 25 chars |
| question-not-interrogative    | question doesn't end with '?' |
| option-count-not-4            | options array length ≠ 4 |
| option-id-not-abcd            | option ids ≠ a/b/c/d (exact, in order) |
| option-too-short              | any option text < 40 chars |
| option-length-ratio           | max(option lengths) / min(option lengths) > 1.4 — keep the four options length-parallel |
| meta-vocab-in-option          | option text contains: incorrect, wrong, partial, anti-pattern, misnomer, overstates, understates, misleading, not supported, deprecated |
| em-dash-in-option             | U+2014 em-dash in an option — use '--' instead |
| option-self-rationale         | option starts with 'because' or 'since' — options must be statements, not justifications |
| markdown-in-option            | option text contains markdown (** _ ` [text](url)) |
| internal-ref-leak             | option text contains an internal ref like 'foo.md:23' or '(:32-43)' |
| correct-id-not-in-options     | correctOptionId not one of the option ids |
| option-explanations-missing   | optionExplanations missing any of a/b/c/d |
| explanation-verdict-mismatch  | per-option explanation doesn't start with 'Correct.' (when id == correctOptionId) or 'Incorrect.' (otherwise) |
| docs-url-missing-or-wrong-host | no docs[] entry, or url not on https://docs.camunda.io/docs/ |
| version-marker-missing        | camundaVersion ≠ '8.8' |
| topic-not-in-blueprint        | topic not one of the 8 listed in the schema |

Additionally:
- Options must be parallel statements — same grammatical form, similar length, no embedded sub-clauses that grade themselves ("which correctly handles..."). The OPTIONS state WHAT, the EXPLANATIONS state WHY.
- Never include phrases like "This approach...", "This pattern...", "Camunda 8 supports/allows/requires...", "teams should...", "is the canonical/recommended approach", "However,...", "In reality,..." inside option text. Save all that for the explanation fields.
- Distractors must be plausible Camunda traps (Camunda-7 confusion, version drift, similar-but-different element, wrong scope, wrong direction of mapping, wrong cardinality). They must NOT be obviously absurd.
- Every fact (the correct answer AND why each distractor is wrong) must be supported by the SOURCE chunk below. No facts pulled from outside the chunk except universally-known C8.8 schema constants.

### Authoring rubric (distilled)

- **Style "scenario"** (most items): scenario sets a concrete C8.8 situation with a named company + measurable; question asks a single targeted question; options are 4 parallel WHAT-statements; explanations carry the WHY.
- **Style "concept"**: scenario can be lighter on narrative but must still cite a measurable from the docs (e.g. "default retry count of 3"). Question targets a definition or rule.
- **Style "recall"**: scenario describes a real configuration choice; question asks which value/expression/property is required. Still needs domain marker + measurable.

### Source chunk — ALL facts in your answer must trace back to this content

**File**: `pipeline/sources/connectors/http-webhook.md`
**Public URL**: https://docs.camunda.io/docs/components/connectors/protocol/http-webhook/
**Section heading**: Verification expression

```markdown
### Verification expression

The verification expression allows you to return a custom HTTP response without triggering process correlation. This feature supports multiple scenarios beyond one-time verification challenges, including:

- **One-time verification challenges**: Respond to webhook provider verification requests (e.g., Slack, GitHub).
- **Request validation**: Reject invalid or malformed requests before a process instance is created.
- **Conditional responses**: Return different responses based on request content.

#### How it works

When the verification expression evaluates to a **non-null** value:

1. The webhook returns the specified response immediately.
2. Process correlation does not occur.
3. Activation conditions, HMAC validation, and the rest of the webhook pipeline are skipped.

When the verification expression evaluates to **null**:

1. The webhook continues with normal processing.
2. Activation conditions are evaluated.
3. HMAC validation (if configured) is performed.
4. Process correlation proceeds as usual.

#### Response format

Use the following references to access incoming request data:

- Body: `request.body.`
- Headers: `request.headers.`
- URL parameters: `request.params.`

To construct a response, use these fields in the returned object:

- **`body`** – for example:  
  `{"body": {"challenge": request.body.challenge}}`
- **`statusCode`** – for example:  
  `{"statusCode": 201, "body": {"result": "ok"}}`  
  If omitted, the default status code is **200**.
- **`headers`** – for example:  
  `{"headers": {"Content-Type": "application/json"}, "body": {"result": "ok"}}`

Use FEEL expressions to build and transform the response content as needed.

#### Example: One-time verification challenge

A common use-case is a [one-time verification challenge](https://webhooks.fyi/security/one-time-verification-challenge).

For example, consider the following verification challenge from [Slack](https://slack.com/):

```json
{
  "token": "Jhj5dZrVaK7ZwHHjRyZWjbDl",
  "challenge": "3eZbrw1aBm2rZgRNFdxV2595E9CY3gmdALWMmHkvFXO7tYXAYM8P",
  "type": "url_verification"
}
```

To confirm the Slack events subscription, you must return the following response:

```
HTTP 200 OK
Content-type: application/json
{"challenge":"3eZbrw1aBm2rZgRNFdxV2595E9CY3gmdALWMmHkvFXO7tYXAYM8P"}
```

To do so, the **Verification expression** field may look like:

```feel
=if request.body.type = "url_verification"
then {"body": {"challenge": request.body.challenge}, "statusCode": 200}
else null
```

#### Example: Request validation

You can validate incoming requests and reject invalid payloads before creating a process instance:

```feel
=if request.body.requiredField = null
then {"body": {"error": "Missing required field"}, "statusCode": 400}
else null
```

This expression checks if `requiredField` is missing and returns a `400 Bad Request` status with an error message. If the field is present, it returns `null`, allowing normal webhook processing to continue.

#### Example: Custom status codes

You can return any HTTP status code, including non-standard or conflict codes:

```feel
=if request.body.challenge != null
then {"body": {"challenge": request.body.challenge}, "statusCode": 409}
else null
```

#### Example: Custom headers

You can include custom headers in your response:

```feel
=if request.body.challenge != null
then {
  "body": {"challenge": request.body.challenge},
  "headers": {"Content-Type": "application/camunda-bin"}
}
else null
```

#### Example: Nested body structure

You can access and respond to nested data structures in the request:

```feel
=if request.body.event_type = "verification"
then {"body": {"challenge": request.body.event.challenge}}
else null
```

This example extracts the challenge from a nested `event` object and returns it in the response.
```

### Final reminders

1. Write the JSON to **pipeline/generation/outputs/connectors/con-http-webhook-26.json** and nothing else.
2. The id MUST be `con-http-webhook-26`.
3. The docs[0].url MUST be `https://docs.camunda.io/docs/components/connectors/protocol/http-webhook/`.
4. camundaVersion MUST be the string `"8.8"`.
5. Every option starts with a capital letter and has NO leading "Because/Since", no markdown, no em-dash.
6. The correct option's `optionExplanations[correctOptionId].text` begins with `Correct.`; each of the other three begins with `Incorrect.`.
7. The `explanation` field is a teaching note — it must NOT begin with "Correct."/"Incorrect.".
