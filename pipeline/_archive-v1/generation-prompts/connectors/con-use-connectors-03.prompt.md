### Strict lint rules (any violation → reject)

| Code                          | Rule |
| ----------------------------- | ---- |
| scenario-too-short            | scenario < 150 chars |
| scenario-missing-domain-marker | scenario lacks a named company or domain noun (bank/insurer/saas/healthcare/fintech/logistics/retailer/airline/marketplace/...) |
| scenario-missing-measurable   | scenario lacks a number with unit: €/$ amount, %, duration (PT2H / "2 hours"), or count ("3000 claims") |
| question-too-short            | question < 25 chars |
| question-not-interrogative    | question doesn't end with '?' |
| option-count-not-4            | options array length ≠ 4 |
| option-id-not-abcd            | option ids ≠ a/b/c/d (exact, in order) |
| option-too-short              | any option text < 40 chars |
| option-length-ratio           | max(option lengths) / min(option lengths) > 1.4 — keep the four options length-parallel |
| meta-vocab-in-option          | option text contains: incorrect, wrong, partial, anti-pattern, misnomer, overstates, understates, misleading, not supported, deprecated |
| em-dash-in-option             | U+2014 em-dash in an option — use '--' instead |
| option-self-rationale         | option starts with 'because' or 'since' — options must be statements, not justifications |
| markdown-in-option            | option text contains markdown (** _ ` [text](url)) |
| internal-ref-leak             | option text contains an internal ref like 'foo.md:23' or '(:32-43)' |
| correct-id-not-in-options     | correctOptionId not one of the option ids |
| option-explanations-missing   | optionExplanations missing any of a/b/c/d |
| explanation-verdict-mismatch  | per-option explanation doesn't start with 'Correct.' (when id == correctOptionId) or 'Incorrect.' (otherwise) |
| docs-url-missing-or-wrong-host | no docs[] entry, or url not on https://docs.camunda.io/docs/ |
| version-marker-missing        | camundaVersion ≠ '8.8' |
| topic-not-in-blueprint        | topic not one of the 8 listed in the schema |

Additionally:
- Options must be parallel statements — same grammatical form, similar length, no embedded sub-clauses that grade themselves ("which correctly handles..."). The OPTIONS state WHAT, the EXPLANATIONS state WHY.
- Never include phrases like "This approach...", "This pattern...", "Camunda 8 supports/allows/requires...", "teams should...", "is the canonical/recommended approach", "However,...", "In reality,..." inside option text. Save all that for the explanation fields.
- Distractors must be plausible Camunda traps (Camunda-7 confusion, version drift, similar-but-different element, wrong scope, wrong direction of mapping, wrong cardinality). They must NOT be obviously absurd.
- Every fact (the correct answer AND why each distractor is wrong) must be supported by the SOURCE chunk below. No facts pulled from outside the chunk except universally-known C8.8 schema constants.

### Authoring rubric (distilled)

- **Style "scenario"** (most items): scenario sets a concrete C8.8 situation with a named company + measurable; question asks a single targeted question; options are 4 parallel WHAT-statements; explanations carry the WHY.
- **Style "concept"**: scenario can be lighter on narrative but must still cite a measurable from the docs (e.g. "default retry count of 3"). Question targets a definition or rule.
- **Style "recall"**: scenario describes a real configuration choice; question asks which value/expression/property is required. Still needs domain marker + measurable.

### Source chunk — ALL facts in your answer must trace back to this content

**File**: `pipeline/sources/connectors/use-connectors.md`
**Public URL**: https://docs.camunda.io/docs/components/connectors/use-connectors/
**Section heading**: Error expression

```markdown
### Error expression

To support flexible exception handling,
the [out-of-the-box connectors](/components/connectors/out-of-the-box-connectors/available-connectors-overview.md) allow
users to define an **Error Expression** in the **Error Handling** section at the bottom of the properties panel.

The example below uses this property to automatically inform the right group of people depending on the result of an
HTTP request against an internal website. If the website returns a valid result, this data is passed on to the regular
team.
In case of a [404](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/404) website response, the administrator is
informed, so they can check why the website cannot be reached. HTTP responses with
status [500](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/500)
indicate internal website errors, which is why the website team is informed.

![feel connectors](../img/use-connectors-error-general.png)

The **Error Expression** property requires a [FEEL](/components/modeler/feel/what-is-feel.md) expression that yields a
BPMN error object in the end. The BPMN error object can be an
empty [context](/components/modeler/feel/language-guide/feel-data-types.md#context),
[null](/components/modeler/feel/language-guide/feel-data-types.md#null), or a context containing at least a non-empty
`errorType` and a non-empty `code` if the error type is `bpmnError`. You can use all available functionality provided by
FEEL to produce this result.

Use the provided FEEL functions:

- [`bpmnError`](#function-bpmnerror) to create a BPMN error object. This triggers
  a [ThrowError call](/components/best-practices/development/dealing-with-problems-and-exceptions.md) to the workflow
  engine.
- [`jobError`](#function-jobError) to create a fail job object. This triggers
  a [FailJob call](/components/best-practices/development/dealing-with-problems-and-exceptions.md) to the workflow
  engine.

The `bpmnError` FEEL function optionally allows you to pass variables as the third parameter. You can combine this with
a boundary event to use the variables in condition expressions when handling the error event. Example FEEL expression:

```
if response.body.status = "failed" then bpmnError("FAILED", "The action failed", response.body) else null
```

Within the FEEL expression, you access the following temporary variables:

- The result of the connector in `response`.
- The job of the invocation in `job` with the fields: `retries`
- Any result variables created by the **Result Variable** and **Result Expression** properties (see
  the [REST connector](/components/connectors/protocol/rest.md#response), for example).
- The technical exception that potentially occurred in `error`, containing a `message` and optionally a `code`. The code
  is only available if the connector's runtime behavior provided a code in the exception it threw.

Building on that, you can cover those use cases with BPMN errors that you consider as exceptional. This can build on
technical exceptions thrown by a connector as well as regular results returned by the external system you integrated.
The [example expressions](#bpmn-error-examples) below can serve as templates for such scenarios.
```

### Final reminders

1. Write the JSON to **pipeline/generation/outputs/connectors/con-use-connectors-03.json** and nothing else.
2. The id MUST be `con-use-connectors-03`.
3. The docs[0].url MUST be `https://docs.camunda.io/docs/components/connectors/use-connectors/`.
4. camundaVersion MUST be the string `"8.8"`.
5. Every option starts with a capital letter and has NO leading "Because/Since", no markdown, no em-dash.
6. The correct option's `optionExplanations[correctOptionId].text` begins with `Correct.`; each of the other three begins with `Incorrect.`.
7. The `explanation` field is a teaching note — it must NOT begin with "Correct."/"Incorrect.".


<!-- LINT REWORK -->

### Lint feedback from previous attempt

Your previous output failed these strict lints. Fix every one of them and rewrite the JSON file:

- [scenario-missing-measurable] scenario lacks a number/currency/duration anchor @ scenario

Overwrite `pipeline/generation/outputs/connectors/con-use-connectors-03.json` with a corrected JSON document and stop.
