### Strict lint rules (any violation → reject)

| Code                          | Rule |
| ----------------------------- | ---- |
| scenario-too-short            | scenario < 150 chars |
| scenario-missing-domain-marker | scenario lacks a named company or domain noun (bank/insurer/saas/healthcare/fintech/logistics/retailer/airline/marketplace/...) |
| scenario-missing-measurable   | scenario lacks a number with unit: €/$ amount, %, duration (PT2H / "2 hours"), or count ("3000 claims") |
| question-too-short            | question < 25 chars |
| question-not-interrogative    | question doesn't end with '?' |
| option-count-not-4            | options array length ≠ 4 |
| option-id-not-abcd            | option ids ≠ a/b/c/d (exact, in order) |
| option-too-short              | any option text < 40 chars |
| option-length-ratio           | max(option lengths) / min(option lengths) > 1.4 — keep the four options length-parallel |
| meta-vocab-in-option          | option text contains: incorrect, wrong, partial, anti-pattern, misnomer, overstates, understates, misleading, not supported, deprecated |
| em-dash-in-option             | U+2014 em-dash in an option — use '--' instead |
| option-self-rationale         | option starts with 'because' or 'since' — options must be statements, not justifications |
| markdown-in-option            | option text contains markdown (** _ ` [text](url)) |
| internal-ref-leak             | option text contains an internal ref like 'foo.md:23' or '(:32-43)' |
| correct-id-not-in-options     | correctOptionId not one of the option ids |
| option-explanations-missing   | optionExplanations missing any of a/b/c/d |
| explanation-verdict-mismatch  | per-option explanation doesn't start with 'Correct.' (when id == correctOptionId) or 'Incorrect.' (otherwise) |
| docs-url-missing-or-wrong-host | no docs[] entry, or url not on https://docs.camunda.io/docs/ |
| version-marker-missing        | camundaVersion ≠ '8.8' |
| topic-not-in-blueprint        | topic not one of the 8 listed in the schema |

Additionally:
- Options must be parallel statements — same grammatical form, similar length, no embedded sub-clauses that grade themselves ("which correctly handles..."). The OPTIONS state WHAT, the EXPLANATIONS state WHY.
- Never include phrases like "This approach...", "This pattern...", "Camunda 8 supports/allows/requires...", "teams should...", "is the canonical/recommended approach", "However,...", "In reality,..." inside option text. Save all that for the explanation fields.
- Distractors must be plausible Camunda traps (Camunda-7 confusion, version drift, similar-but-different element, wrong scope, wrong direction of mapping, wrong cardinality). They must NOT be obviously absurd.
- Every fact (the correct answer AND why each distractor is wrong) must be supported by the SOURCE chunk below. No facts pulled from outside the chunk except universally-known C8.8 schema constants.

### Authoring rubric (distilled)

- **Style "scenario"** (most items): scenario sets a concrete C8.8 situation with a named company + measurable; question asks a single targeted question; options are 4 parallel WHAT-statements; explanations carry the WHY.
- **Style "concept"**: scenario can be lighter on narrative but must still cite a measurable from the docs (e.g. "default retry count of 3"). Question targets a definition or rule.
- **Style "recall"**: scenario describes a real configuration choice; question asks which value/expression/property is required. Still needs domain marker + measurable.

### Exemplars (same topic — match this voice and structure, NOT the subject)

### Source chunk — ALL facts in your answer must trace back to this content

**File**: `pipeline/sources/connectors/use-connectors.md`
**Public URL**: https://docs.camunda.io/docs/components/connectors/use-connectors/
**Section heading**: Using secrets

```markdown
## Using secrets

:::danger
`secrets.*` is a deprecated syntax. Instead, use `{{secrets.*}}`
:::

You can use sensitive information in your connectors without exposing it in your BPMN processes by referencing secrets.
Use the Console component to [create and manage secrets](/components/console/manage-clusters/manage-secrets.md).

You can reference a secret like `MY_API_KEY` with `{{secrets.MY_API_KEY}}` in any connector field in the properties
panel that supports this.
Each of
the [out-of-the-box connectors](/components/connectors/out-of-the-box-connectors/available-connectors-overview.md)
details which fields support secrets.

Secrets are **not variables** and must be wrapped in double quotes as follows when used in a FEEL expression:

```
= { myHeader: "{{secrets.MY_API_KEY}}"}
```

Using the secrets placeholder syntax, you can use secrets in any part of a text, like in the following FEEL expression:

```
= "https://" + baseUrl + "/{{secrets.TENANT_ID}}/accounting"
```

This example assumes there is a process variable `baseUrl` and a configured secret `TENANT_ID`.

The engine will resolve the `baseUrl` variable and pass on the secrets placeholder to the connector. Assuming the
`baseUrl` variable resolves to `my.company.domain`,
the connector receives the input `"https://my.company.domain/{{secrets.TENANT_ID}}/accounting"`. The connector then
replaces the secrets placeholder upon execution.

For further details on how secrets are implemented in connectors, consult
our [Connector SDK documentation](/components/connectors/custom-built-connectors/connector-sdk.md#secrets).

:::note Warning
`secrets.*` is a reserved syntax. Don't use this for other purposes than referencing your secrets in connector fields.
Using this in other areas can lead to unexpected results and incidents.
:::
```

### Final reminders

1. Write the JSON to **pipeline/generation/outputs/connectors/con-use-connectors-05.json** and nothing else.
2. The id MUST be `con-use-connectors-05`.
3. The docs[0].url MUST be `https://docs.camunda.io/docs/components/connectors/use-connectors/`.
4. camundaVersion MUST be the string `"8.8"`.
5. Every option starts with a capital letter and has NO leading "Because/Since", no markdown, no em-dash.
6. The correct option's `optionExplanations[correctOptionId].text` begins with `Correct.`; each of the other three begins with `Incorrect.`.
7. The `explanation` field is a teaching note — it must NOT begin with "Correct."/"Incorrect.".
