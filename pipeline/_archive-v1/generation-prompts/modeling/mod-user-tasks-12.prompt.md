### Strict lint rules (any violation → reject)

| Code                          | Rule |
| ----------------------------- | ---- |
| scenario-too-short            | scenario < 150 chars |
| scenario-missing-domain-marker | scenario lacks a named company or domain noun (bank/insurer/saas/healthcare/fintech/logistics/retailer/airline/marketplace/...) |
| scenario-missing-measurable   | scenario lacks a number with unit: €/$ amount, %, duration (PT2H / "2 hours"), or count ("3000 claims") |
| question-too-short            | question < 25 chars |
| question-not-interrogative    | question doesn't end with '?' |
| option-count-not-4            | options array length ≠ 4 |
| option-id-not-abcd            | option ids ≠ a/b/c/d (exact, in order) |
| option-too-short              | any option text < 40 chars |
| option-length-ratio           | max(option lengths) / min(option lengths) > 1.4 — keep the four options length-parallel |
| meta-vocab-in-option          | option text contains: incorrect, wrong, partial, anti-pattern, misnomer, overstates, understates, misleading, not supported, deprecated |
| em-dash-in-option             | U+2014 em-dash in an option — use '--' instead |
| option-self-rationale         | option starts with 'because' or 'since' — options must be statements, not justifications |
| markdown-in-option            | option text contains markdown (** _ ` [text](url)) |
| internal-ref-leak             | option text contains an internal ref like 'foo.md:23' or '(:32-43)' |
| correct-id-not-in-options     | correctOptionId not one of the option ids |
| option-explanations-missing   | optionExplanations missing any of a/b/c/d |
| explanation-verdict-mismatch  | per-option explanation doesn't start with 'Correct.' (when id == correctOptionId) or 'Incorrect.' (otherwise) |
| docs-url-missing-or-wrong-host | no docs[] entry, or url not on https://docs.camunda.io/docs/ |
| version-marker-missing        | camundaVersion ≠ '8.8' |
| topic-not-in-blueprint        | topic not one of the 8 listed in the schema |

Additionally:
- Options must be parallel statements — same grammatical form, similar length, no embedded sub-clauses that grade themselves ("which correctly handles..."). The OPTIONS state WHAT, the EXPLANATIONS state WHY.
- Never include phrases like "This approach...", "This pattern...", "Camunda 8 supports/allows/requires...", "teams should...", "is the canonical/recommended approach", "However,...", "In reality,..." inside option text. Save all that for the explanation fields.
- Distractors must be plausible Camunda traps (Camunda-7 confusion, version drift, similar-but-different element, wrong scope, wrong direction of mapping, wrong cardinality). They must NOT be obviously absurd.
- Every fact (the correct answer AND why each distractor is wrong) must be supported by the SOURCE chunk below. No facts pulled from outside the chunk except universally-known C8.8 schema constants.

### Authoring rubric (distilled)

- **Style "scenario"** (most items): scenario sets a concrete C8.8 situation with a named company + measurable; question asks a single targeted question; options are 4 parallel WHAT-statements; explanations carry the WHY.
- **Style "concept"**: scenario can be lighter on narrative but must still cite a measurable from the docs (e.g. "default retry count of 3"). Question targets a definition or rule.
- **Style "recall"**: scenario describes a real configuration choice; question asks which value/expression/property is required. Still needs domain marker + measurable.

### Source chunk — ALL facts in your answer must trace back to this content

**File**: `pipeline/sources/modeling/user-tasks.md`
**Public URL**: https://docs.camunda.io/docs/components/modeler/bpmn/user-tasks/
**Section heading**: Assignments

```markdown
### Assignments

User tasks support specifying assignments, using the `zeebe:AssignmentDefinition` extension element.
This can be used to define which user the task can be assigned to. One or all of the following
attributes can be specified simultaneously:

- `assignee`: Specifies the user assigned to the task. [Tasklist](/components/tasklist/introduction-to-tasklist.md) will claim the task for this user.
- `candidateUsers`: Specifies the users that the task can be assigned to.
- `candidateGroups`: Specifies the groups of users that the task can be assigned to.

:::info
Usernames and group IDs in the Orchestration Cluster are case-sensitive. When you set `assignee`, `candidateUsers`, or `candidateGroups`, always use the exact value from your identity provider or Identity user record, including case. For example, `abc@example.com` and `Abc@example.com` are treated as different users.

You can also use assignment resources to configure [user task access restrictions in Tasklist](/components/tasklist/user-task-access-restrictions.md) when using Tasklist V1, so that only the assignee, candidate users, and members of candidate groups can see and work on a task. In Tasklist V2, candidate users and candidate groups are not evaluated by Tasklist for task visibility or assignment. Tasklist V2 relies on authorization-based access control at the process-definition level only.
:::

Typically, the assignee, candidate users, and candidate groups are defined as [static values](/components/concepts/expressions.md#expressions-vs-static-values) (e.g. `some_username`, `some_username, another_username` and
`sales, operations`), but they can also be defined as
[expressions](/components/concepts/expressions.md) (e.g. `= book.author` and `= remove(reviewers, book.author)` and `= reviewer_roles`). The expressions are evaluated on activating the user task and must result in a
`string` for the assignee and a `list of strings` for the candidate users and a `list of strings` for the candidate groups.

For [Tasklist](/components/tasklist/introduction-to-tasklist.md) to claim the task for a known Tasklist user,
the value of the `assignee` must be the user's **unique identifier**.
The unique identifier depends on the authentication method used to login to Tasklist:

- Camunda 8 (login with email, Google, GitHub): `email`
- Default Basic authentication (Elasticsearch): `username`
- IAM: `username`

These assignees are not related to user restrictions, which is related to the visibility of the task in Tasklist for Self-Managed.

:::note
For example, say you log into Tasklist using Camunda 8 login with email using your email address `foo@bar.com`. Every time a user task activates with `assignee` set to value `foo@bar.com`, Tasklist automatically assigns it to you. You'll be able to find your new task under the task dropdown option `Assigned to me`.

### Final reminders

1. Write the JSON to **pipeline/generation/outputs/modeling/mod-user-tasks-12.json** and nothing else.
2. The id MUST be `mod-user-tasks-12`.
3. The docs[0].url MUST be `https://docs.camunda.io/docs/components/modeler/bpmn/user-tasks/`.
4. camundaVersion MUST be the string `"8.8"`.
5. Every option starts with a capital letter and has NO leading "Because/Since", no markdown, no em-dash.
6. The correct option's `optionExplanations[correctOptionId].text` begins with `Correct.`; each of the other three begins with `Incorrect.`.
7. The `explanation` field is a teaching note — it must NOT begin with "Correct."/"Incorrect.".
