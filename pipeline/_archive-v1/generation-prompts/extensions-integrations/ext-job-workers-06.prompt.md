### Strict lint rules (any violation → reject)

| Code                          | Rule |
| ----------------------------- | ---- |
| scenario-too-short            | scenario < 150 chars |
| scenario-missing-domain-marker | scenario lacks a named company or domain noun (bank/insurer/saas/healthcare/fintech/logistics/retailer/airline/marketplace/...) |
| scenario-missing-measurable   | scenario lacks a number with unit: €/$ amount, %, duration (PT2H / "2 hours"), or count ("3000 claims") |

| em-dash-in-option             | U+2014 em-dash in an option — use '--' instead |
| option-self-rationale         | option starts with 'because' or 'since' — options must be statements, not justifications |
| markdown-in-option            | option text contains markdown (** _ ` [text](url)) |
| internal-ref-leak             | option text contains an internal ref like 'foo.md:23' or '(:32-43)' |

| version-marker-missing        | camundaVersion ≠ '8.8' |
| topic-not-in-blueprint        | topic not one of the 8 listed in the schema |

Additionally:
- Options must be parallel statements — same grammatical form, similar length, no embedded sub-clauses that grade themselves ("which correctly handles..."). The OPTIONS state WHAT, the EXPLANATIONS state WHY.
- Never include phrases like "This approach...", "This pattern...", "Camunda 8 supports/allows/requires...", "teams should...", "is the canonical/recommended approach", "However,...", "In reality,..." inside option text. Save all that for the explanation fields.
- Distractors must be plausible Camunda traps (Camunda-7 confusion, version drift, similar-but-different element, wrong scope, wrong direction of mapping, wrong cardinality). They must NOT be obviously absurd.
- Every fact (the correct answer AND why each distractor is wrong) must be supported by the SOURCE chunk below. No facts pulled from outside the chunk except universally-known C8.8 schema constants.

### Authoring rubric (distilled)

- **Style "scenario"** (most items): scenario sets a concrete C8.8 situation with a named company + measurable; question asks a single targeted question; options are 4 parallel WHAT-statements; explanations carry the WHY.
- **Style "concept"**: scenario can be lighter on narrative but must still cite a measurable from the docs (e.g. "default retry count of 3"). Question targets a definition or rule.
- **Style "recall"**: scenario describes a real configuration choice; question asks which value/expression/property is required. Still needs domain marker + measurable.

### Source chunk — ALL facts in your answer must trace back to this content

**File**: `pipeline/sources/extensions-integrations/job-workers.md`
**Public URL**: https://docs.camunda.io/docs/components/concepts/job-workers/
**Section heading**: Backpressure

```markdown
### Backpressure

To avoid workers overloaded with too many jobs, e.g. running out of memory:

- The workers rely on the [built-in gRPC flow control mechanism](https://grpc.io/docs/guides/flow-control/).
- Or, if lacking for your language of choice, [the built-in HTTP/2 stream flow control](https://httpwg.org/specs/rfc7540.html#FlowControl), e.g. Golang implementation of gRPC.

Essentially, as jobs are pushed downstream from the broker to the client, they're first buffered in the gateway where the direct client connection resides. The gateway only sends as much data as the client can consume over a specific connection. If it notices its send buffers fill up, it marks a client as `not-ready`. This can happen, for example, if the client's receive method is blocked/suspended.

If a client is not ready to receive a job, the gateway instead tries to re-route the job to another logically equivalent worker. If this fails (e.g. all workers connected to a specific gateway are not ready), the job is returned to the broker. There, it may be retried to another gateway, if and only if it has a logically equivalent worker.

#### Implementing backpressure

If you're using the raw `StreamActivatedJobs` RPC, or want to add support for this to your client of choice, the criteria to apply backpressure is to stall the underlying HTTP/2 transport. To do so, you may need to block the thread in which the gRPC stream is running (e.g. Java), or suspend the coroutine (e.g. Kotlin, Go). Once the transport stops receiving, this causes the gateway's send buffers to fill up, and effectively apply backpressure.

If you wish to test this, you can do so by simulating a very slow worker with your new implementation. Then, start generating many jobs on the server side (e.g. create many process instances with lots of jobs). You should then observe backpressure via server side metrics, or many `Job.YIELD` commands written to the log.

Refer to the [client implementations](https://github.com/camunda/camunda/tree/main/clients) for more information.

#### Detecting backpressure

There are different ways to detect backpressure.

On the client side, you can use the job worker metrics to do so. For example, by subtracting the rate of handled jobs (i.e. `camunda.client.worker.job.handled`) from the rate of activated jobs (i.e. `camunda.client.worker.job.activated`), you can estimate the rate of queued jobs. If this is too close to the `maxJobsActive` consistently, this may indicate you need to scale your worker deployment.

:::warning Deprecated metrics
The following metrics are deprecated and will be removed in version 8.10:

- `zeebe.client.worker.job.activated`, replace with `camunda.client.worker.job.activated`
- `zeebe.client.worker.job.handled`, replace with `camunda.client.worker.job.handled`

Please update your monitoring integrations to use the new metrics before upgrading to version 8.10.
:::

:::note
If you're using Prometheus, you can use the following query to estimate the queue size of your workers. We recommend adding a job type label to be able to group per workload, e.g. `sum(zeebe_client_worker_job_activated_total - zeebe_client_worker_job_handled_total) by (jobType)`
:::

On the server side (e.g. if you're running a self-managed cluster), you can measure the rate of jobs which are not pushed due to clients which are not ready via the metric `zeebe_broker_jobs_push_fail_try_count_total{code="BLOCKED"}`. If the rate of this metric is high for a sustained amount of time, it may be a good indicator that you need to scale your workers. Unfortunately, on the server side we don't differentiate between clients, so this metric doesn't tell you which worker deployment needs to be scaled. We thus recommend using client metrics whenever possible.
```

### Final reminders

1. Write the JSON to **pipeline/generation/outputs/extensions-integrations/ext-job-workers-06.json** and nothing else.
2. The id MUST be `ext-job-workers-06`.
3. The docs[0].url MUST be `https://docs.camunda.io/docs/components/concepts/job-workers/`.
4. camundaVersion MUST be the string `"8.8"`.
5. Every option starts with a capital letter and has NO leading "Because/Since", no markdown, no em-dash.
6. The correct option's `optionExplanations[correctOptionId].text` begins with `Correct.`; each of the other three begins with `Incorrect.`.
7. The `explanation` field is a teaching note — it must NOT begin with "Correct."/"Incorrect.".
