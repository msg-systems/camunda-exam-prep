### Strict lint rules (any violation → reject)

| Code                          | Rule |
| ----------------------------- | ---- |
| scenario-too-short            | scenario < 150 chars |
| scenario-missing-domain-marker | scenario lacks a named company or domain noun (bank/insurer/saas/healthcare/fintech/logistics/retailer/airline/marketplace/...) |
| scenario-missing-measurable   | scenario lacks a number with unit: €/$ amount, %, duration (PT2H / "2 hours"), or count ("3000 claims") |
| question-too-short            | question < 25 chars |
| question-not-interrogative    | question doesn't end with '?' |
| option-count-not-4            | options array length ≠ 4 |
| option-id-not-abcd            | option ids ≠ a/b/c/d (exact, in order) |
| option-too-short              | any option text < 40 chars |
| option-length-ratio           | max(option lengths) / min(option lengths) > 1.4 — keep the four options length-parallel |
| meta-vocab-in-option          | option text contains: incorrect, wrong, partial, anti-pattern, misnomer, overstates, understates, misleading, not supported, deprecated |
| em-dash-in-option             | U+2014 em-dash in an option — use '--' instead |
| option-self-rationale         | option starts with 'because' or 'since' — options must be statements, not justifications |
| markdown-in-option            | option text contains markdown (** _ ` [text](url)) |
| internal-ref-leak             | option text contains an internal ref like 'foo.md:23' or '(:32-43)' |
| correct-id-not-in-options     | correctOptionId not one of the option ids |
| option-explanations-missing   | optionExplanations missing any of a/b/c/d |
| explanation-verdict-mismatch  | per-option explanation doesn't start with 'Correct.' (when id == correctOptionId) or 'Incorrect.' (otherwise) |
| docs-url-missing-or-wrong-host | no docs[] entry, or url not on https://docs.camunda.io/docs/ |
| version-marker-missing        | camundaVersion ≠ '8.8' |
| topic-not-in-blueprint        | topic not one of the 8 listed in the schema |

Additionally:
- Options must be parallel statements — same grammatical form, similar length, no embedded sub-clauses that grade themselves ("which correctly handles..."). The OPTIONS state WHAT, the EXPLANATIONS state WHY.
- Never include phrases like "This approach...", "This pattern...", "Camunda 8 supports/allows/requires...", "teams should...", "is the canonical/recommended approach", "However,...", "In reality,..." inside option text. Save all that for the explanation fields.
- Distractors must be plausible Camunda traps (Camunda-7 confusion, version drift, similar-but-different element, wrong scope, wrong direction of mapping, wrong cardinality). They must NOT be obviously absurd.
- Every fact (the correct answer AND why each distractor is wrong) must be supported by the SOURCE chunk below. No facts pulled from outside the chunk except universally-known C8.8 schema constants.

### Authoring rubric (distilled)

- **Style "scenario"** (most items): scenario sets a concrete C8.8 situation with a named company + measurable; question asks a single targeted question; options are 4 parallel WHAT-statements; explanations carry the WHY.
- **Style "concept"**: scenario can be lighter on narrative but must still cite a measurable from the docs (e.g. "default retry count of 3"). Question targets a definition or rule.
- **Style "recall"**: scenario describes a real configuration choice; question asks which value/expression/property is required. Still needs domain marker + measurable.

### Source chunk — ALL facts in your answer must trace back to this content

**File**: `pipeline/sources/extensions-integrations/service-integration-patterns.md`
**Public URL**: https://docs.camunda.io/docs/components/best-practices/development/service-integration-patterns/
**Section heading**: Tasks vs. events

```markdown
### Tasks vs. events

The **execution semantics of send and receive events is identical with send and receive tasks**, so you can express the very same thing with tasks or events.

However, there is one small difference that might be relevant: **only tasks can have boundary events**, which allows to easily model when you want to cancel waiting for a message:

![Boundary events](service-integration-patterns-assets/boundary-event.png)

Despite this, the whole visual representation is of course different. In general, tasks are easier understood by most stakeholders, as they are used very often in BPMN models.

However, in certain contexts, such as event-driven architectures, events might be better suited as the concept of events is very common. Especially, if you apply domain-driven design (DDD) and discuss domain events all day long, it might be intuitive that events are clearly visible in your BPMN models.

Another situation better suited for events is if you send events to your internal reporting system besides doing “the real” business logic. Our experience shows that the smaller event symbols are often unconsciously treated as less important by readers of the model, leading to models that are easier to understand.

|                | Send task                | Receive task             | Send event                                                                                                              | Receive event                                                                                                           |
| :------------- | :----------------------- | :----------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Recommendation | Prefer tasks over events | Prefer tasks over events | Use only if you consistently use events over tasks and have a good reason for doing so (e.g. event-driven architecture) | Use only if you consistently use events over tasks and have a good reason for doing so (e.g. event-driven architecture) |

:::note
The choice about events vs. commands also [needs to be reflected in the naming of the element](../../modeling/naming-bpmn-elements), as a task emphasizes the action (e.g. "wait for response") and the event reflects what happened (e.g. "response received").

### Final reminders

1. Write the JSON to **pipeline/generation/outputs/extensions-integrations/ext-service-integration-patterns-158.json** and nothing else.
2. The id MUST be `ext-service-integration-patterns-158`.
3. The docs[0].url MUST be `https://docs.camunda.io/docs/components/best-practices/development/service-integration-patterns/`.
4. camundaVersion MUST be the string `"8.8"`.
5. Every option starts with a capital letter and has NO leading "Because/Since", no markdown, no em-dash.
6. The correct option's `optionExplanations[correctOptionId].text` begins with `Correct.`; each of the other three begins with `Incorrect.`.
7. The `explanation` field is a teaching note — it must NOT begin with "Correct."/"Incorrect.".
